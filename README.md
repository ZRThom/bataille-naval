# Battleship Game Rules

**Battleship** is a strategy game played between two players. Each player has a grid (usually 10x10) on which they place their ships and try to guess the locations of the opponent’s ships. The goal of the game is to sink all of the opponent’s ships before they sink yours.

## Materials

Each player has:
- One 10x10 grid.
- 5 ships of different sizes:
  - 1 Aircraft Carrier (5 cells)
  - 1 Battleship (4 cells)
  - 1 Cruiser (3 cells)
  - 1 Submarine (3 cells)
  - 1 Destroyer (2 cells)

## Game Setup

1. **Placing Ships**: Each player secretly places their ships on their grid. Ships may be placed horizontally or vertically, but **not diagonally**.
2. Ships must not overlap and must not touch each other (optional rule depending on game version).
3. Ship placement must remain **hidden** from the opponent.

## How to Play

1. **Taking Turns**: Players take turns calling out a coordinate on the opponent’s grid (e.g., `A5`) to fire a shot.
2. **Opponent's Response**:
   - If the shot hits a ship, the opponent announces **"Hit"**.
   - If the shot misses, the opponent announces **"Miss"** (or "Water").
3. When all cells of a ship have been hit, the opponent announces **"Ship sunk"**.

## End of the Game

The game ends when one player has successfully sunk all of the opponent’s ships.  
The player who sinks all enemy ships first is declared the winner.

## Additional Rules

- **One shot per turn.** A player may not fire at the same coordinate twice.
- **Ship visibility:** Once a ship is sunk, the entire ship’s position is revealed (optional).
- **Fair play:** Players must follow placement and shooting rules—no cheating.
- **Optional rule:** Add sonar or radar abilities for more advanced gameplay.

## Strategy Tips

- Vary ship placement to make your layout harder to guess.
- Avoid placing ships too close together, unless you want to mislead your opponent.
- Keep track of previous shots to predict your opponent’s strategy.

Good luck and have fun!
